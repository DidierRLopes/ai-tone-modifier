# AI Tone Modifier

This was inspired by a [video from Apple at WWDC24](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10140/) about **Add personality to your app through UX writing**.

_Every app has a personality that comes across in what you say — and how you say it. Learn how to define your app's voice and modulate your tone for every situation, from celebratory notifications to error messages. We'll help you get specific about your app's purpose and audience and practice writing in different tones._
